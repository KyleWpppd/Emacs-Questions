These are snippets of code that have been useful to me!

Batch rename a bunch of files with SVN MV.

code
for i in *; do j=`echo $i | cut -d . -f 2,3,4,5,6`; j=$j; svn mv $i $j; done
/code

for each file
echo the name to cut
cut at delimeter '.'
grab the next 5 (2-6) pieces after the dot
rename them into j
svn move original file $i to $j
finis!
